I'm a consultant in Intensive Care and Anaesthesia, not a programmer - so don't judge me on the quality of my code. I'm interested in using computers and data to optimise the routine and improve patient care.

Interests are in critical care computing, data science, home automation, and renewable technologies.

The main technologies I use:
 - :computer: Python, PHP, R
 - :open_file_folder: SQL Server, MySQL, SQlite
